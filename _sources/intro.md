# Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL or DRL) is the integration of deep learning methods, classically used in supervised or unsupervised learning contexts, with reinforcement learning (RL), a well-studied adaptive control method used in problems with delayed and partial feedback.

These are the lecture notes for the module **Deep Reinforcement Learning** taught by Dr. Julien Vitay at the Technische Universit√§t Chemnitz, Faculty of Computer Science, Professorship for Artificial Intelligence. 

The content will be uploaded on a regular basis during the semester. Registration to the course happens on OPAL:

<https://bildungsportal.sachsen.de/opal/auth/RepositoryEntry/21637267457>

Each section is accompanied by a video (the slides are also available) and followed by some lecture notes which summarize the most important points to understand. Some sections are optional in the sense that no questions will be asked at the exam, but those interested in becoming neural network experts should feel free to study them.

Exercises are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks, allowing to implement in Python at your own pace the algorithms seen in the lectures and learn to use reinforcement learning libraries such as `gym`.
