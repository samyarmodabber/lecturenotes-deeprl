# Deep Reinforcement Learning

These are the lecture notes for the module **Deep Reinforcement Learning** taught by Dr. Julien Vitay at the Technische Universit√§t Chemnitz, Faculty of Computer Science, Professorship for Artificial Intelligence. 

The content will be uploaded on a regular basis during the semester. Registration to the course happens on [OPAL](https://bildungsportal.sachsen.de/opal/auth/RepositoryEntry/21637267457). Each section/lecture is accompanied by a set of videos, the slides and some lecture notes which summarize the most important points to understand. The videos are integrated in the lecture notes, but you can also access the complete playlist on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIEjdhhAF7UJwegwyWUcDrUNJTQfxMcUw).

Exercises are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks, allowing to implement in Python at your own pace the algorithms seen in the lectures and learn to use reinforcement learning libraries such as `gym`. A notebook to work on and the solution are downloadable at the top-right of each page. A video explaining the exercise and one commenting the solution are available, with the playlist being on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIEjdhhAF7UJdex6a4gEajx9GuPtJ9WCC).
