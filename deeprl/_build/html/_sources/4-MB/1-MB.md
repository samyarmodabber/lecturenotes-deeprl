## Model-free vs. model-based RL

In **model-free RL** (MF) methods, we do not need to know anything about the dynamics of the environment to start learning a policy:

$$p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t) \; \; r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$$

We just sample transitions $(s, a, r, s')$ and update Q-values or a policy network. The main advantage is that the agent does not need to "think" when acting: just select the action with highest Q-value (**reflexive behavior**). The other advantage is that you can use MF methods on **any** MDP: you do not need to know anything about them. But MF methods are very slow (sample complexity): as they make no assumption, they have to learn everything by trial-and-error from scratch.

If you had a **model** of the environment, you could plan ahead (what would happen if I did that?) and speed up learning (do not explore stupid ideas): **model-based RL** (MB). 
In chess, players **plan** ahead the possible moves up to a certain horizon and evaluate moves based on their emulated consequences.
In real-time strategy games, learning the environment (**world model**) is part of the strategy: you do not attack right away.


## Model Predictive Control (MPC)

Learning the world model is not complicated in theory.
We just need to collect *enough* transitions $s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, r_{t+1}$ using a random agent (or during learning) and train a model to predict the next state and reward.

Such a model is called the **dynamics model**, the **transition model** or the **forward model**: **What happens if I do that?** The model can be deterministic (use neural networks) or stochastic (use Gaussian Processes). Given an initial state $s_0$ and a policy $\pi$, you can unroll the future using the local model.

Once you have a good transition model, you can generate **rollouts**, i.e. imaginary trajectories / episodes using the model.

$$\tau = (s_o, a_o, r_ 1, s_1, a_1, \ldots, s_T)$$

You can then feed these trajectories to any model-free algorithm (value-based, policy-gradient) that will learn to maximize the returns.

$$\mathcal{J}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau}[R(\tau)]$$

```

The only sample complexity is the one needed to train the model: the rest is **emulated**. Drawback: This can only work when the model is close to perfect, especially for long trajectories or probabilistic MDPs.

For long horizons, the slightest imperfection in the model can accumulate (**drift**) and lead to completely wrong trajectories.
The emulated trajectory cannot be generated by the current policy $\pi_\theta$, the policy gradient is biased (especially if you are on-policy), the algorithm does not converge. If you have a perfect model, you should not be using RL anyway as classical control methods would be much faster (but see AlphaGo).

The solution is to **replan** at each time step and execute the first planned action **in the real environment**.

**Model Predictive Control** iteratively plans complete trajectories, but only selects the first action.

The planner can actually be anything, it does not have to be a RL algorithm. For example, it can be iLQR (Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator), a non-linear optimization method (see <https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/rl-lqr-ilqr-linear-quadratic-regulator-a5de5104c750>).


Alternatively, one can use **random-sampling shooting**:

1. in the current state, select a set of possible actions.
2. generate rollouts with these action and compute their returns using the model.
3. select the action whose rollout has the highest return.

```

The main advantage of MPC is that you can change the reward function (the **goal**) on the fly: what you learn is the model, but planning is just an optimization procedure. You can set intermediary goals to the agent very flexibly: no need for a well-defined reward function. Model imperfection is not a problem as you replan all the time. The model can adapt to changes in the environment (slippery terrain, simulation to real-world).

## Dyna-Q

Another approach to MB RL is to **augment** MF methods with MB rollouts. The MF algorithm (e.g. Q-learning) learns from transitions $(s, a, r, s')$ sampled either with:

* **real experience**: interaction with the environment.
* **simulated experience**: simulation by the model.

```


If the simulated transitions are good enough, the MF algorithm can converge using much less **real transitions**, thereby reducing its **sample complexity**. The **Dyna-Q** algorithm {cite}`Sutton1990` is an extension of Q-learning to integrate a model $M(s, a) = (s', r')$. The model can be tabular or approximated with a NN.

```{admonition} Dyna-Q

* Initialize values $Q(s, a)$ and model $M(s, a)$.

* **for** $t \in [0, T_\text{total}]$:

    * Select $a_t$ using $Q$, take it on the **real environment** and observe $s_{t+1}$ and $r_{t+1}$.

    * Update the Q-value of the **real** action:

    $$\Delta Q(s_t, a_t) = \alpha \, (r_{t+1} + \gamma \, \max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t, a_t))$$

    * Update the model:

    $$M(s, a) \leftarrow (s_{t+1}, r_{t+1})$$

    * **for** $K$ steps:

        * Sample a state $s_k$ from a list of visited states.

        * Select $a_k$ using $Q$, predict $s_{k+1}$ and $r_{k+1}$ using the **model** $M(s_k, a_k)$.

        * Update the Q-value of the **imagined** action:

        $$\Delta Q(s_k, a_k) = \alpha \, (r_{k+1} + \gamma \, \max_a Q(s_{k+1}, a) - Q(s_k, a_k))$$
```

It is interesting to notice that Dyna-Q is very similar to DQN and its **experience replay memory**.
In DQN, the ERM stores **real transitions** generated in the past.
In Dyna-Q, the model generates **imagined transitions** based on past real transitions.
