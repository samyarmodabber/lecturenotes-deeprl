# Deep Reinforcement Learning

These are the lecture notes for the module **Deep Reinforcement Learning** taught by Dr. Julien Vitay at the Technische Universit√§t Chemnitz, Faculty of Computer Science, Professorship for Artificial Intelligence. 

The content will be uploaded on a regular basis during the semester. Registration to the course happens on OPAL:

<https://bildungsportal.sachsen.de/opal/auth/RepositoryEntry/21637267457>

Each section is accompanied by a video (the slides are also available) and followed by some lecture notes which summarize the most important points to understand. 

Exercises are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks, allowing to implement in Python at your own pace the algorithms seen in the lectures and learn to use reinforcement learning libraries such as `gym`.
